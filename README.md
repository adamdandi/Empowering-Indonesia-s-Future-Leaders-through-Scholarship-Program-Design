### Overview Headline:
**Developing a Holistic Scholarship Program to Empower First-Year University Students in Indonesia**

### Overview:
This project involved designing a comprehensive scholarship program aimed at addressing financial, academic, and personal growth challenges faced by first-year university students in Indonesia. Through market sizing, needs assessments, and benchmarking, the project focused on providing not only tuition support but also mentorship, career development, and community engagement to cultivate future leaders. The initiative is aligned with YBM BRILiaN’s mission to drive societal change by supporting education access and personal development.

### Data Details:
- **Source**: Data from government agencies (BPS, Kementerian Pendidikan), industry partners (LPDP, Djarum Foundation), and previous successful scholarship programs.
- **Size**: The program scope includes an initial budget allocation of $2 million to support 400 students, with further scalability based on market insights.
- **Key Variables**: Financial needs (tuition, allowances), academic resources (mentorship, tutoring), career development (job workshops, industry partnerships), and societal impact (volunteer hours, community contribution).

### Problem Statement:
The challenge was to design a scholarship program that goes beyond financial aid and fosters holistic development, preparing students for academic success, career readiness, and societal contributions. The objective was to ensure that the scholarship impacts students' lives in a meaningful and sustainable way.

### Solution:
The solution involved the following steps:
- **Market Sizing**: Used TAM, SAM, and SOM frameworks to assess the potential reach and impact of the scholarship program, estimating the number of students who would benefit from it.
- **Needs Assessment**: Identified key student needs such as financial aid, academic resources, personal development opportunities, and career mentoring.
- **Program Components**: Developed key program components including full/partial tuition, living stipends, mentoring, and structured volunteerism, based on best practices from established scholarship programs (e.g., LPDP, Djarum Foundation).
- **SWOT Analysis**: Identified potential challenges (e.g., funding limitations, student engagement) and proposed solutions (e.g., strategic partnerships, targeted recruitment efforts).

### Insight:
The key insights from the analysis included:
- **Financial Barriers**: A significant portion of new entrants into higher education (15.8%) face economic challenges, which this program aims to mitigate.
- **Student Needs**: Beyond financial support, students need mentorship, career advice, and mental health support to thrive academically and personally.
- **Impact on Society**: By fostering community engagement and leadership skills, the program is poised to create a ripple effect, benefiting not only the students but the broader society.

### Recommendation:
To maximize the program's effectiveness, it is recommended that YBM BRILiaN:
1. Establish strong partnerships with universities and industry leaders for mentorship and career development.
2. Implement continuous monitoring and evaluation metrics, including retention rates, academic success, and post-graduation outcomes.
3. Promote structured volunteer opportunities to ensure students contribute to societal development, helping them become responsible leaders.
